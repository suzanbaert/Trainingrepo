Next up forcats.

but before that, there are 2 dplyr ones that can help:

recode
Recode values
Description
This is a vectorised version of
switch()
:  you can replace numeric values based on their position,
and character values by their name.  This is an S3 generic:  dplyr provides methods for numeric,
character,  and  factors.   For  logical vectors,  use
if_else()
.   For  more  complicated criteria,  use
case_when()
.
Usage
recode(.x, ..., .default = NULL, .missing = NULL)
recode_factor(.x, ..., .default = NULL, .missing = NULL, .ordered = FALSE)
