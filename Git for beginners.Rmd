Objective of teh post
The below workflows are mostly focused on backing up your repostiories rather than collaboration. 

What if collaborative?
git pull origin master rather than git pull in general


# What is GIT and Github?



# Getting started
### Github account
Make a github account so you can work on your own project from multiple computers, you can share and collaborate or even just to have your history backed-up somewhere.

### Git installation
Download and follow the instructions on git-scm.com

### First time set-up
Open the GIT bash or command program to configure your user name and email.
To double check that the values are saved, 

```{}
#Configure your user settings:
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "Your.Email@email.com"

#Check that the values are saved:
$ git config --global --list
```





# Workflows 1: Getting your 

## 1.1 Starting a new repository on GIT
The easiest case is to start a completely new repository with GIT version control.

Step 1: Make a new repository on github and save the link XXXXXXXXXXXX

Step 2: Make a new project in R studio with GIT control and copy the link 
Alternative is to make a project in Rstudio as you normally would do.




## 1.2 An existing repository that doesn't yet exist on your computer

Browse to the directory you want to use for this local copy:
$ git clone Enter_your_Github_URL 

## 1.3




# Workflow 2: Basic commits of your work

```{}
#First check whether you have the latest material
$ git pull

#Optional: check the differences between working directory, staging area and git directory
$ git status

#Optional: what are the changes I made to the code
$ git diff

#Add all the files to the staging area
$ git add -A

#Make a commit on your work
$ git commit -m "enter your commit message"

#Push your latest commit to github
$ git push
```


<br>

# Workflow 3: Branches
Bigger changes are best made on a branch first, and only merged onto the master after they are fully working

you can create the remote branch at any time, after checkout or only just before the first push. I find it easiest to make it straight after creation so I don't forget

Adding -u ensures that the local and remote branch are connected.

```{}
#Optional: List all existing branches (local and remote)
$ git branch -a

#Creating a new branch locally
$ git branch YourBranchName

#Creating the new branch remotely
$ git push -u origin YourBranchName

#Swapping to the new branch to work on
$ git checkout YourBranchName
```


(...)
#Work, add, commit and push on the new branch 
(...)

Ready to merge the branch with the master?

```{}
#Changing back to master branch
$ git checkout master

#Make sure your copy of master is up to date
$ git pull origin master

#Merging the branch on the master
$ git merge YourBranchName

#Optional: check the merged branches, YourBranchName should be in the list
$ git branch --merged

#Push the changes to master
$ git push origin master

#Deleting the branch locally
$ git branch -d YourBranchName

#Deleting the branch remotely
$ git push origin --delete YourBranchName

```



<br>

# Workflow 4: Ooops... I want to undo

```{}
#Undo the changes made on an R file (not staged yet!) and return the previous version
$ git checkout filename.R


#I commited on the wrong branch?
$ git log

#Removing files from the staging area to working directory
$ git reset
```




<br>
# Workflow 5: Oh no... undo-undo-undo

```{}
Show log
$ git log

Quit the log list when you got what you need



```





#I commited on the wrong branch?
#find the previous hjas
$ git log 

$ git checkout BranchName

#cherry-pick commit from master to branch
$ git cherry-pick paste_haschode_here

#shows log on branchname with the new commit
$ git log

#deleting the commit on the master branch
$ git checkout master
$ git reset 




### git resets

$ git reset --soft paste_haschode_here
  Reset to specified commit, but will keep changes in the staging area
  
$ git reset  paste_haschode_here
  Default setting. Reset to specified commit, changes are in the working directory rather than the staging area

$ git reset --hard paste_haschode_here
  Really don't want the changes made, I want to go back to where we were before. All files will match the state    they were at the previous commit. Clears staging area and working directory on tracked files.

#cleans any untracked files and folders
$ git clean -df



# Appendix


### Browsing and terminology 
cd foldername
cd ..
#shows inside contents 
$ ls

Naming
* Origin: the name of the remote repository
* Master: the default name of the primary branch
* HEAD: 


## Git add 
* git add -A    stages all files
* git add .     stages new and modified, without deleted
* git add -u    stages modified and deleted, without new
* git add file.R stages just the 'file.R' file
